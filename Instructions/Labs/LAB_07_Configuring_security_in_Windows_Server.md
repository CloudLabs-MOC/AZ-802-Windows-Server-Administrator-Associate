# Lab 07: Configuring security in Windows Server

## Lab Overview

In this hands-on-lab, you will implement key security features in Windows Server to protect credentials, identify vulnerable accounts, and enforce secure password management. You will enable Windows Defender Credential Guard to prevent credential theft, use PowerShell to locate and secure problematic accounts, and deploy Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) to automate local administrator password management. These tasks will help strengthen security in an enterprise environment by reducing attack surfaces and enforcing best practices.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you'll be working on:

- **Exercise 1:** Configuring Windows Defender Credential Guard.
- **Exercise 2:** Locating problematic accounts.
- **Exercise 3:** Implementing Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)
  
## Estimated time: 1 hr 45 Minutes

## Exercise 1: Configuring Windows Defender Credential Guard

In this exercise, you will enable and configure Windows Defender Credential Guard using Group Policy and assess hardware readiness to protect credentials from theft.

>**Note**: In the lab environment, Credential Guard will not be available on VMs because they don't meet the prerequisites. This, however, will not prevent you from stepping through the process of implementing it by using Group Policy and evaluating its readiness by using corresponding tools.

### Task 1: Enable Windows Defender Credential Guard using Group Policy

In this task, you will enable Windows Defender Credential Guard using Group Policy. You will create and configure a Group Policy Object (GPO) to enforce Credential Guard settings and apply them to the IT Organizational Unit (OU).

1. Connect to **SEA-SVR2** and, if needed, sign in as **CONTOSO\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

     >**NOTE:** If you are unable to see drop-down menu to select VMs, please wait for 3-5 minutes, refresh the lab page and check again.

   ```powershell
   Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $true -and PasswordNeverExpires -eq $true}
   ```

   ![](./Media/lab1-image18.png)

1. Review the list of user accounts returned.

1. To enable password expiration for all user accounts in the result set, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $true -and PasswordNeverExpires -eq $true} | Set-ADUser -PasswordNeverExpires $false
   ```

    ![](./Media/lab1-image19.png)

1. To verify the outcome, rerun the command from step 2 and notice that no results are returned.

### Task 2: Locate and disable domain accounts that have not been used to sign in for at least 90 days

In this task, you will identify domain accounts that have been inactive for at least 90 days and disable them to reduce security risks associated with stale accounts.

1. To identify Active Directory user accounts that have not been used to sign in for at least 90 days, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   $days = (Get-Date).AddDays(-90)
   Get-ADUser -Filter {LastLogonTimeStamp -lt $days -and enabled -eq $true} -Properties LastLogonTimeStamp
   ```

   ![](./Media/lab1-image21.png)

   > **Note**: In the lab environment, no results will be returned.

### Task 3: Deploy LAPS client-side extension

In this task, you will install the LAPS client-side extension on a target system, apply the Group Policy settings, and force an update to ensure LAPS configurations are applied correctly.

1. Switch to the console session to **SEA-SVR1** and then, if needed, sign in as **CONTOSO\\Administrator**, with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

   > **Note:** You will be prompted to change your password, as a result of running in the previous exercise the script that enables password expiration. Choose an arbitrary password and use it throughout the remainder of the lab. Use the *Tab* key to move between fields while updating the password.

1. Once you sign in, to access the Windows PowerShell command prompt, at the **SConfig** menu prompt, enter **15** and press Enter.
   
   > **Note**: To open Notepad from PowerShell, type **Notepad** and press enter.
